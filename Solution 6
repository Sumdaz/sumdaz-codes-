#1 Write a Python program to rearrange positive and negative numbers in a given list using Lambda functions, so that all positive numbers appear before negative numbers. For example, given [-1, 2, -3, 5, 7, 8, 9, -10], function rearranges positive and negative numbers as follows: [2, 5, 7, 8, 9, -10, -3, -1].
num_list = [-1, 2, -3, 5, 7, 8, 9, -10]
print(num_list)
rearrange_num = sorted(num_list, key = lambda i: 0 if i == 0 else -1/i)
print(rearrange_num)

#2 Write a Python function to extract the nth element from a given list of tuples using lambda.

def extract_nth_element(score_list, n):
    score_sheet_cards= list(map (lambda x:(x[n]), score_list))
    print(score_sheet_cards)
players = [('Auba', 19, 5, 1), ('Sterling', 16, 4, 2), ('Kai', 21, 7, 0), ('Mount', 11, 3, 1), ('Broja', 13, 0, 0), ('Gallagher',7, 7, 2), ('James', 10, 8, 3), ('Jorginho', 5, 8, 2), ('Kovacic', 7, 6, 6), ('Pulisic', 11, 5, 0), ('Cucurella', 3, 2, 1), ('Chilwel', 4, 4, 2), ('Thiago', 5, 3, 0), ('RLC', 3, 2, 4), ('Ziyech', 4, 2, 0), ('Carney', 7, 0, 0), ('Koulibaly', 6, 1, 1), ('Fofana', 2, 2, 4), ('Trevoh', 3, 2, 4), ('Kante', 8, 9, 2)] 
print ("Original list:")
print(players)
n = 0
print("\nExtract nth element ( n =",n,") showing names of the players from the said list of tuples:")
print(extract_nth_element(players, n))
n = 1
print("\nExtract nth element ( n =",n,") showing goals scored by the players in a season from the said list of tuples:")
print(extract_nth_element(players, n))
n = 2
print("\nExtract nth element ( n =",n,") showing yellow cards for the players in a season from the said list of tuples:")
print(extract_nth_element(players, n))
n = 3
print("\nExtract nth element ( n =",n,") showing red cards for the players in a season from the said list of tuples:")
print(extract_nth_element(players, n))


#3 Write a Python function to filter out odd elements of a list, leaving only even list elements. Note: Please do not use built-in 'filter' Python function.

num = list(range(1, 101, 3))
print(num)
# filter numbers odd numbers from num
even = []
for i in num:
    if i%2==0:
        even.append(i)
        
print(even)

#4 Write a list comprehension that prints a list of the cubes of the numbers 1 through a number input by the user.

num = int(input("Please, enter a number: "))
num_list = list(range(1, num+1))
cube = []
for i in num_list:
    cube.append(i*i*i)
print(cube)

#5 Write a Python function get_all_vowels that takes in a string and uses a list comprehension to return all the vowels in the string.

text = input("Please, enter text: ")
get_all_vowels =[char for char in text if char.lower() in 'aeiou']
print(get_all_vowels)
