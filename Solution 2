#1 Write a Python program to calculate sum of digits of any number input by the user
from math import floor
num = int(input("Enter a positive integer number: "))
total = 0
while num>0:
    digit = num % 10
    total = total  + digit
    num = num//10
print ("sum = ", total)

#2 Write a Python program to filter the positive numbers from a list, leaving only non-positive numbers in the list.

list = [1, -4, 5, -10, -12, 4, -7, 18]
print (list)
for i in list:
    if i >= 0:
        list.remove(i)
print("non_positive_numbers are: ", list)

#3 Write a Python program to remove and print every third number from a list of numbers until the list becomes empty

nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 17, 16, 20, 234, 61, 0]
print (nums)
position = 3-1
len_list = len(nums)
index = 0
while len_list > 0:
    index = (position + index) % len_list
    remove_num = nums.pop(index)
    print(remove_num)
    len_list -= 1
print(nums)


#4 Given a list of numbers and a number k, write a Python program to check whether the sum of any two numbers from the list is equal to k or not. For example, given [1, 4, 11, 5] and k = 15, return true since 11 + 4 is 15

list_of_numbers = [6, 13, 7, 4, 9, 5, 8, 1]

#sum of any two numbers to be k = 15
k = 15
for x in list_of_numbers:
    for y in list_of_numbers:
        if x + y == k:    
            print (True)
        else:
            print(False)
            
#5 Write a Python program that receives a (potentially long) text input, converts the string to a list, and prints all the words and their frequencies.

guest_str = input("Please enter string:  ")
word_list = guest_str.split( )
dict = {}
for i in word_list:
    if i not in dict.keys():
        dict[i] = 0
    dict[i] = dict[i] + 1
print(dict)
